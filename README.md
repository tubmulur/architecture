EDRO:<br/>
— What is the future? <br/>
— Future is time, where you can be. <br/>
— Would you have some extra needs, or some extra quality wishes in future? <br/>
— I think yes. We will. <br/>
— Who'll brings us this needs and wishes? <br/>
— Also we are. <br/>
EDRO <br/>
/home/RCe.EDRO/documentation/Vocabulary/Accronimas/EDRO <br/>
EDRO - > Is a sequence of processes, consists of 4 required to be formalized proceeding steps; Each step must be defined after another.
Here are this steps: <br/>
1.[E] Event;
2.[D] Design or Destination (the place where) ;
3.[R] Reality;
4.[O] Objects.
Following explanation will completely describe your situation when you are doing something:
Let's imagine:
— What is your program?
— My program is something, that will satisfy my needs of producing, it is an instrument for producing.
So, how to do something:
1) [O]:You have something with your hands to perform the task. What are it: My instruments to perform the task;
2) [D]:You are doing it somewhere. Where?: Destination or Design template (for web);
3) [R]:Who are you? (More often question is: What are your position? May be suitable for less detailed perfect world);
4) [E]:What are you doing?;
Let's place this questions in order to be asked only once, while crossing this sequence:
1) [E]:What will i do? = Event;
2) [D]:Where am I? = Destination or design (Can't be perfect without knowledge about Event);
3) [R]:Who am I? = Reality for current process. Cannot be answered without understanding, "Where am I";
4) [O]:Instrument to do something for manufacturing=Object;
Example of answering:
I'm
1) [E]:"On the factory"
2) [D]:"What will I do?" You will make some job, so,
3) [R]:"Who am I here?" you are a worker.
4) [O]:"Where is my instruments?" = Objects. Your instruments prepared for "Worker" on the "Factory to "Make some job".
Thus,
1) We can divide our task into component processes,
2) Each process will be described using the EDRO template,
3) Data will be collected in to the following sections of the EDRO compiler..…
|E|.|D|.|R|.|O|.|E|.|D|.|R|.|O| .|E|.|D|.|R|.|O|.|E|.|D|.|R|.|O|.
|E|.|D|.|R|.|O|.|E|.|D|.|R|.|O|.|E|.|D|.|R|.|O|.|E|.|D|.|R|.|O|. 
|E|.|D|.|R|.|O|.|E|.|D|.|R|.|O|. |E|.|D|.|R|.|O|. |E|.|D|.|R|.|O|.

|E|.|D|.|R|.|O|.|E|.|D|.|R|.|O|. |E|.|D|.|R|.|O|. |E|.|D|.|R|.|O|.….. Complete :)
So, example with a real world situation:
1.Director
1) [E]:Event= "We need to manufacture phone”. Let's make a phone!
2) [D]:Destination (Design in web projects): It will be manufactored in a phone factory;
3) [R]:I'm adirector;
4) [O]:Objects: [D]:Phone factory [R]:Management system [O]:Instructions (Hard work :) );
2.Worker_1, Worker_2 …..
1) [E]:Event= "We need to make a deal pedal”;
2) [D]:Destination (Design in web projects) It will be manufactored in a plastic deformation room;
3) [R]:I'm operator;
4) [O]:Objects: [D]: plastic squeezer, [R]:safety glass, ear plugs. [E]: Instructions;
Here is process with 4 workers:
| …Director….
| / ----|-- |--- \
|W1 W2 W3 W4
|E---E---E----E
|D---D--D----D
|R---R---R----R
|O---O--O----O
|\-----|---|---/
-----------------------
Pruduct is ready to sell, this was endpoint Let's express the selling process through the EDRO template :)
-----------------------
EDRO (Event Destination Reality Object):
Process description sequence matrix, for creating constructor of a process consists of processes.
EDRO:
1) Sequence matrix of process, consists of 4 required to be proceeded steps;
2) Each step must be applied to each process separately;
3) Use EDRO template applied in the following direction: →1.E 2.D 3.R 4.O.
No more rules, just create. :)
