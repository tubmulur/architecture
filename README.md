Following will completely describe your situation when you are doing something.

Let's imagine: what is your programm?How to do something. You have something in your hands "Instrument to do something"=Object,.
you are diong it somewhere "Where are you"= Destination or Design template, "Who are you" = Reality, "What are you doing" = Event.
Let's place this questions in order to be asked only once, while crossing this sequence:

1) "What i will do?" = Event;
2) "Where am I?" = Destination or design (Coldn't be perfect without knowledge about Event)
3) "Who am I?" = Reality for current process. Coudn't be answered without understanding, "Where am i" eg..
"On the factory" "What will I do?" You will make some job, so, "Who am I here?" you are a worker.
4) "Where is my instruments?" = Objects. Your instruments prepared for "Worker" on the "Factory to "Make some job".

So we can compile your enviroment completely.

         So 1) Event= "We need  to manufacture phone"
<------>    2) Destination (Design in web projects) It will be manufactored in a phonr factory.
            3) I'm adirector, so my objects will be: Director order system, and director report system.
<------>    4) Object:

         Some manufacturing process.
